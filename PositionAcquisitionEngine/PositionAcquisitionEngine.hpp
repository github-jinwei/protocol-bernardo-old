/** The Position Acquisition engine provides a way of interacting with
 acquisition devices supported by OpenNI ang getting video streams as well as
 real-time human pose estimation.

 Usage of the pae must respect a specific pattern as interaction with OpenNI and NiTE
 is quite unstable. The pae provides multiple checks to prevent most of erroneous actions but some still may happen.

 You access the available devices informations using the `getStatus()` method. This
 returns a structure holding informations about all the devices, their current state, name etc. As well as informations about the users they are tracking.

 The pae provides access to a live view of the video stream of each connected
 devices. This is controlled using the `enableLiveView()` and `disableLiveView()`
 methods BEFORE starting the engine. This will provide an OpenCV window for each
 connected device. When using live view, calls to `getStatus()` must be made from the
 main thread as this is when the windows will be refreshed.

 Actions on the devices are made using the pae directly, and providing serials for
 the concerned device.

 \todo Improve the live view update flow

 \bug OpenNI tends to crash when being stopped, current fix is to free the most of
    used resources without stopping OpenNI
