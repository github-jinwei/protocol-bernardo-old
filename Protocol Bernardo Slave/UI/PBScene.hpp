class PBView;

/** A PBScene is used to display a view on the screen.
 If a view can be contained in another view, a scene is needed to display the root
 view. A Scene takes care of dispatching user events to the currently selected PBControl.

 You should subclass PBScene and use its four events methods: `sceneWillAppear()`,
 `sceneWillRender()`, `sceneDidRender()`, `sceneWillUnload()` to execute your own code.

 A scene is responsible for the view it is holding, and will free its contained views
 when being free-ed.

 Interaction between elements of different scenes, and between scenes themselves,
 should be kept to a strict minimum.

 To remove a view, call `dismiss()`, this will reemove the view from the render
 loop and free its content.
